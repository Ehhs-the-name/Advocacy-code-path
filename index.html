          of the future, it's important to help them seek guidance towards a healthy way of living. Young people part of
          marignalised communites, like the LGBTQ+ and racial identies, are even more at risk having mental health
          issues. If you know someone might need help, do not hesitate to reach out. Below are differnent statisitics

        <ul>
          <li>LGBTQ+ youth are 4x more likely to attempt suicide than their peers.</li>
          <li>The Trevor Project's 2023 survey found that 41% of LGBTQ+ youth have seriously considered suicide, about
            half were trans and nonbinary.</li>
          <li>The Trevor Poject's analysis of CDC data found:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>48% of Bi people considered while 27% attempted.</li>
            <li>37% of Lesbian/Gay people considered while 19% attempted.</li>
            <li>14% of Straight people considered while 6% attempted.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>2020 peer-reviewed study found that trans and non-binary youth were 2 to 2.5 times more likely to
            experience
            serious contemplation of suicide compared to cisgender LGBQ+ peers.</li>
          <li>A 2023 survey found that almost all LGBTQ+ youth that had BIPOC identities reported higher suicide attempt
            rates than their peers.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Indigenous youth who are two spirit/LGBTQ+ consistently report the hiest suicide risk rate.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Some Risk factors for suicide in LGBTQ+ youth:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Minority Stress: where anti-LGBTQ+ messages become internalized.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Examples include experiencing the following due to identity: Housing instabilities, physical harm,
                identity change attempts by parents via conversation camps and the like.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Some preventive factors for LGBTQ+ youth suicide:</li>
          <ul>
            <li> Identity-affirming spaces like homes and schools consistently lower suicide attempt rates for LGBTQ+
              youth.</li>
            <li>Trusted adults and supportive peers have led to reports of higher self-esteem in LGBTQ+ youth.</li>
          </ul>

          <li>An article on Pew Trust gives 3 strategies for combating the fact that from 2007 to 2020 the suicide rate
            for black youth has risen 144%.</li>
          <li>The 3 stratigies:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Increase healthcare providers' understanding of the cultures they provide care to.</li>
            <li>Research risk factors focusing on different minority identities.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Research shows that black youth show symptoms of depression (a suicide risk factor) differently than
                white peers.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Aggression and irritability present more for depression than sadness and a lack of interest in
                  things.
                </li>
                <li>All relates to distrust of healthcare professionals due to centuries of exploration and abuse.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Diagnostic criteria being created primarily around white people leads to misclassification and
                inappropriate medical responses, increasing someone's suicide risk.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Black youth are often misdiagnosed when they experience suicidal tendencies.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Still, less than 50% of youth go on outpatient after being in the ER for self-harm, and it's less for
                Black youth.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Due to a 2019 report to Congress, funding for the study of suicide risk and preventive factors, like
            stigma
            and connectedness of communities, has increased.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Points on the statistics on black youth and 3 strategies to counter suicide rates rising in the black youth
          populous can apply to other races too. One of the reasons Two-Spirit Indigenous youth might be facing the
          highest suicide risk rates is because of the intersections of minority stress they face and the lack of
          specific research into their situation.</p>

          The image above is working as the wireframe image(s) for this section. The plan was to make this into a short javascript quiz. Though... Yeah...</p>
        <p>This would've stayed blank until I was able to work out the javascript for the quiz, but I unfortunately did
          not have enough time to add the quiz to this project during my time with CodePath. Hopefully in the near
          future, I'll have an afternoon or so to code this bad boy up.
        </p>
        <p>For now, I humbly request that you take this <a href="https://forms.gle/zEX97NcW3n7MfieQ8"
            target="_blank">Google Forms survey</a> in the meantime, if you desperately want to take a quiz. I was using
          it as my "wireframe" for the JavaScript I will eventually make, but... We'll say, my time was stolen.</p>

        <p>Mental Illness is sometimes called and an invisible affliction, but even though you can't see it, it doesn't
          mean you can't help. A supportive community is a key factor in preventing suicide, and you have the power to
          be a pillar of support. Reaching out shows the sufferer that they're not alone and that they don't have to be
          going through it alone. Even if you don't personally know anyone who's presenting any risk factors, it doesn't
          hurt to reach out to someone and let them know you're there for them. Whether it be a younger cousin, a niece
          or nephew, or a peer, you have the power to make a difference in their life by just reassuring them.</p>
